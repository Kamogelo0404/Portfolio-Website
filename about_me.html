           <p style="color:#7f4f24";> My name is Kamogelo Precious Nkadimeng. I am 22 years of age, I am from a 
            small village</br> in Limpopo called Elandskraal. I attended school there from Primary until Secondary.
            During my</br> childhood, I was a very clever girl, who enjoyed going to school and playing rugby. My dream was
            to become a</br> Climatologist, because of the love I had for geography and also future climate expectations.</br></p>

           <p style="color:#7f4f24"; > But that was my only dream before I knew about Software Development. In 2017, I matriculated</br> in Kubela Secondary
            School. Things were very hard but I managed to progress and obtained Admission to Bachelor's Dregree.</br>
            In 2018 I went to university, I enrolled in Bsc in Mathematical and Computer Sciences. I did not really know
            about</br> what Computer Science is, but I knew that it is a very good field of study with lot of life opportunities.</br>
            </p>

            <p style="color:#7f4f24"; >  Studying Computer Science helped me to know about Software Development. It is not an easy field</br> to accomplish
            but I worked hard to secure my future. I now hold a qualification in Mathematical Science,</br> majored in Computer Science
            and Statistics, studied from the University of Limpopo. I love Software Dev because it is a</br> continuous learning
            process as technology keeps on evolving and I learn new skills everyday. It also provides me a</br> chance to help other
            people through the power of technology. My goal is to grow more in the field of technology.   </p>
